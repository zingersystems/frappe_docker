# Workspace Continuity

## Progress

- 2026-07-12: Installed DOX `AGENTS.md` and initialized the workspace DOX hierarchy for the Frappe bench, app collection, custom apps, research, and VS Code examples.
- 2026-07-12: Added continuity and automatic commit workflow requirements so future agents record handoff context and commit validated changes per affected repository.

## Decisions

- Use `AGENTS.md` for stable contracts and `CONTINUITY.md` for progress, decisions, memories, and handoff notes.
- Commit changes separately in each affected Git repository, including nested custom app repositories under `frappe-bench/apps/`.
- Do not commit unrelated dirty files or runtime artifacts when making scoped workflow or implementation changes.

## Memory

- Parent Git repository root is `/workspace`; the active project folder is `/workspace/development`.
- `frappe-bench/apps/academia_core`, `frappe-bench/apps/academia_catuc`, and `frappe-bench/apps/frappe_pay_connect` are nested Git repositories.

## Handoff

- Root and bench-level DOX files are tracked by the parent repository after `.gitignore` exceptions.
- App-level DOX and continuity files should be committed from inside their nested app repositories.
